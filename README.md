# Keystroke-dynamics
Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished by their typing rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the author of a written text. Participants of this study were made to type in the following password: .tie5Roanl  
The data are arranged as a table with 34 columns. The first three columns are subject, sessionIndex and repetetion number of the password.  
The remaining 31 columns present the timing information for the password. The name of the column encodes the type of timing information. Column names of the form H.key designate a hold time for the named key (i.e., the time from when key was pressed to when it was released). Column names of the form DD.key1.key2 designate a key down-key down time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when key1 was pressed to when key2 was pressed). Column names of the form UD.key1.key2 designate a key up-key down time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when key1 was released to when key2 was pressed). Note that UD times can be negative, and that H times and UD times add up to DD times.
